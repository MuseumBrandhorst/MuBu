# MuBu V1

MuBU V1 is the first scalable prototype version of the MuBu concept.
It consists of a custom PCB and uses standard prototyping components such as Adafruit microcontroller boards and others.
As such, MuBu V1 can be easily replicated using point to point wiring of the single components or by ordering the provided PCB design.
